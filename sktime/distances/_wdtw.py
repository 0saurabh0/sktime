        lower_bounding: LowerBounding or int, defaults = LowerBounding.NO_BOUNDING
            Lower bounding technique to use.

            Integer that is the radius of the sakoe chiba window (if using Sakoe-Chiba

            Distance function to used to compute distance between timeseries.
        bounding_matrix: np.ndarray (2d of size mxn where m is len(x) and n is len(y))
            Custom bounding matrix to use. If defined then other lower_bounding params
            and creation are ignored. The matrix should be structure so that indexes
            considered in bound should be the value 0. and indexes outside the bounding
            matrix should be infinity.
        g: float, defaults = 0.
            Constant that controls the curvature (slope) of the function; that is, g
            controls the level of penalisation for the points with larger phase
            difference.
        kwargs: dict
            Extra arguments for custom distance should be put in the kwargs. See the
            documentation for the distance for kwargs.
