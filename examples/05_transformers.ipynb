    "Transformers are modularized data processing steps commonly used in machine learning. `sktime` introduces transformer types related to time series, which can be used in pipeline constructs across learning tasks. For instance, the same time series feature extractor could be used in a forecasting pipeline, or a time series classification pipeline.\r\n",

    "1. read through the [transformer extension template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/extension_templates/transformer.py) - this is a `python` file with `todo` blocks that mark the places in which changes need to be added.\r\n",

    "3. copy the transformer extension template to a local folder in your own repository (local/private extension), or to a suitable location in your clone of the `sktime` or affiliated repository (if contributed extension), inside `sktime.transformations`; rename the file and update the file docstring appropriately.\r\n",
    "4. address the \"todo\" parts. Usually, this means: changing the name of the class, setting the tag values, specifying hyper-parameters, filling in `__init__`, `_fit`, `_transform`, and optional methods such as `_inverse_transform` or `_update` (for details see the extension template). You can add private methods as long as they do not override the default public interface. For more details, see the extension template.\r\n",
    "5. to test your estimator manually: import your estimator and run it in the worfklows in Section 1; then use it in the compositors in Section 3.\r\n",
    "6. to test your estimator automatically: call `sktime.tests.test_all_estimators.test_estimator` on your estimator - note that the function takes the class, not an object instance. Before the call, you need to register the new estimator in `sktime.tests._config`, as an import, and by adding default parameter settings to the `ESTIMATOR_TEST_PARAMS` variable (the `dict` entry `key` is the class, and entry is a `scikit-learn` parameter set). `pytest` will also add the call to its automated tests in a working clone of the `sktime` repository.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In case of direct contribution to `sktime` or one of its affiliated packages, additionally:\r\n",
    "* add yourself as an author to the code, and to the `CODEOWNERS` for the new estimator file(s).\r\n",
    "* create a pull request that contains only the new estimators (and their inheritance tree, if it's not just one class), as well as the automated tests as described above.\r\n",
    "* in the pull request, describe the estimator and optimally provide a publication or other technical reference for the strategy it implements.\r\n",

    "* `sktime` comes with several forecasting algorithms (or forecasters), all of which share a common interface. The interface is fully interoperable with the `scikit-learn` interface, and provides dedicated interface points for forecasting in batch and rolling mode.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* `sktime` comes with rich composition functionality that allows to build complex pipelines easily, and connect easily with other parts of the open source ecosystem, such as `scikit-learn` and individual algorithm libraries.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* `sktime` is easy to extend, and comes with user friendly tools to facilitate implementing and testing your own forecasters and composition principles."
